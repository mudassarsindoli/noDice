This project is a simple website that displays the outcomes of four randomly rolled dice using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website features a button that, when clicked, generates new random numbers for each die and updates the display accordingly. The layout is clean and organized, with four dice arranged in a row within a container. The styling is minimalist, using only basic colors, fonts, and borders to emphasize the functionality of the dice. The JavaScript code is concise and efficient, using a single function to handle the dice rolls and updating the DOM elements accordingly. Overall, this project demonstrates proficiency in front-end web development skills, including HTML layout, CSS styling, and JavaScript programming.
